IAM is an AWS service that is used to grant user permissions to other AWS services 

Steps in creating, IAM users, Groups and enabling MFA

Creating IAM users and Groups
•	Log into the management console (preferably one with admin privileges)
•	Search for IAM and click on it
•	Click on users, then add users
•	Select username and AWS access types, you can tick just the Aws Management Console access or both (Programmatic access) depending on the users need
•	Create custom password 
•	Go to permissions, select attach existing policies directly
•	Click on AdministratorAccess (this will give this user admin access and you can use this account to login and practice subsequently instead of your root account)
•	Click on tags, type in ‘Name’ as the key and ‘Admin Permissions’ as value 
•	Review and then click create user
•	Make sure to download the csv file and rename it (the file contains the login credentials of the user)
•	On the IAM page, click on groups then create new group
•	Select a group name e.g ITAdmin, attach AdministratorAccess policy
•	Click on create group

NB: Best practice is to assign user policy based on groups.
